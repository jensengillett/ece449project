ECE449 Project

This was a project to use VHDL to implement a 16-bit CPU on a BASYS 3 FPGA board for the UVic class ECE449.
Some notes:
-The branch prediction code does not fully work. There were issues discovered late in testing that were not addressed in time.
-It is possible to modify the files to enable hardware support, but hardware clocks do not work properly and this was not fixed.
-The project is designed to be loaded in Xilinx Vivado. It was developed on 2024.1.
